    <h1>Kate</h1>
      <p>Here is mine if you still need it! My coming out story wasn’t actually that horrible, it was terrifying and scary. It made me incredibly anxious but I was ready to come clean. I didn’t want to hide anymore. I just wanted to be me. I came out to my brother first, actually he guessed that I was gay before I could say a thing. He laughed and hugged me, he told that he’s known for quite a while. It was a relief. Because if my brother could accept me, then that meant other people could to. I came out to my mom next, she told me she had a feeling as well and that it didn’t matter who I was or who I loved, I was her daughter and she’d love me no matter what. It was my dad who was the worst. He couldn’t and can’t accept that his daughter is gay. It bothers him. He still doesn’t want to accept me for who I am but I don’t care because I’m proud of who I am. I’m done hiding who I am. The lgbt community means everything to me, the community is like my second family. It makes me feel safe, the lgbt community makes me feel like I don’t have to hide and that I can be whoever I want to be despite what others think. The community is important to me because it’s helped shape who I am today, it’s made me grow more confident in myself and my sexuality.<3
