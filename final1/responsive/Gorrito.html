      <p>Coming out isn’t always the horror stories you see in movies or shows, but it’s also not as easy as you see there either. For everyone it’s different. For me, it happened in stages. Coming out started in high school for me, where it was easiest with like-minded teenagers who had the capability of understanding who I was and accepting me as such. I had to come to terms with myself, and with my upbringing it wasn’t easy. After many trials and tribulations, I finally discovered that I am indeed a lesbian, and I started talking with a friend and from there it became easier. After a group of friends, I started being open with strangers and then it never seemed important to bring it up. The next stage was my family, which was much harder. It’s been four years now since coming out to my mother and she’s still not accepting of me, nor of my marriage. But I wouldn’t trade it for anything. Coming out is incredibly important, it’s a part of finding yourself, your life, and your future. The LGBT+ community has been a life saver, be it a support group or even just a handful of people who make it feel a little less lonesome. It makes me think of the “Nature vs. Nurture” debate. A lot of us have been conditioned to view things a certain way, the “nature” of how we were brought up. The “nurture” aspect, is the community. The LGBT+ community has helped me to see that being who you are is okay, and it’s something we should celebrate, not condemn. Being a part of this community has saved my life, and allowed me the opportunity to have not only a future, but also a family and a future with my wife. Regardless of who it is that ever makes you feel less than human for being who you are, there’s an army of like-minded individuals behind you ready to pick you up when you fall.<3
