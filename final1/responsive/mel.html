      <p>When I was like 12 I had my first crush on a girl, but I was so scared and I didn’t want to feel that way so I tried my best to ignore it. Years later I realized that what I felt was okay, I wasn’t doing anything wrong. But it wasn’t completely good until I met this woman that made me believe more in myself and that I deserve to tell the world what I feel. After all, this transition was so hard for me, especially not telling my parents because they were my best friends. Then one day I decided I wanted to be transparent with them, I told my mom first that I liked girls and she was so confused because I have had boyfriends before. I did explain that I still like men it’s just that it doesn’t have to be black or white, it can be gray. She told me she kinda knew but she denied the fact because she never wanted me to get hurt or have people treat me badly. Then I told my Dad and surprisingly he was so supportive and told me “I love you more than anything, I love who you are” even though I knew it was hard for him too. A few weeks after I told them I got married, with a wonderful woman. When my parents got to meet her they fell in love with her, they treat her like a daughter, they always ask about her and love her so much. Coming out with friends was so much easier, all of them were always supportive and they told me that doesn’t change anything I am the same person, just with a different partner. Coming out was one of the best decisions I have ever made because I feel so FREE, the people I love accept me and I ACCEPT ME which is the most important thing. I am thankful for the LGBT+ people that I have met because they have helped me a lot in this journey of knowing myself more and more, they have given me a lot of bravery, love and support and that’s why I feel blessed. I’ve gained friends that have been in the same situations as me and understood everything. This community is so important and strong and I am really proud to be a part of it.
