    <h1>Stefy</h1>
      <p>When I was younger, I knew I wasn't exactly like  everyone else. I've always felt an attraction to girls just like I did with boys. I grew up with a very supportive mom, who also happens to be bi, so when I told her I had a crush on a girl in my class she immediately accepted me. I'm so grateful to have someone so supportive in my life and I try not to take it for granted due to all the kids who may not have a parent like mine. The LGBT community is so important to me not only as someones who is bisexual but also as someone who is nonbinary. Even though there are so many people who don't understand the "gender debate", I always feel a comfort with others who are LGBT. I know that someone apart of the community will always accept and love me for exactly who I am. Due to this, no matter where I go there will always be someone who I can be completely comfortable around since they have an understanding of what someone who is LGBT goes through everyday. We all have to deal with ignorant people out in the world but we always have eachother. I'm so happy that I'm apart of a community where everyone accepts you no matter who you love or what your gender is.<3
